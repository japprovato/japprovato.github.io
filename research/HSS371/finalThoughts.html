<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do these negative outcomes mean for our society? If we continue down this path of disconnection as a society because all of our ‘ports’ are connected to technology instead of each other, we will see definite negative effects. There could very likely be a decline in social skills and an increase in depression and anxiety as a result of focusing too heavily on Computer-Mediated communication instead of in-person interactions. If children grow up interacting with people more via Computer-Mediated communication instead of face-to-face social interactions they would most likely stunt their development socially, vocally, and potentially additional integral developmental fields. The direction that our online dating sites are going in is one of the most alarming points of discussion, because it is normalizing objectification of people in our society which is something we want to eliminate, not embrace. If we continue to be as deeply connected to our devices instead of each other, we are bound to head down a dangerous road. We need to embrace the intrinsic value of people around us, and release our grips on our consumer technology.</p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is a field that is constantly surpassing what we as a society ever imagined possible. Advancements in technology have done immeasurable amounts of good in our world and this project would not want to discredit any of those accomplishments. This project merely seeks to unfold the truths behind how technology has disconnected us as a society in its efforts to connect us to a greater degree via social networks. Social networks allow users to create their own profile, which seems innocent enough. Potentially unintentionally, these sites cause users’ self-esteem levels to be at risk of becoming lower as a result of our society’s comparative culture. The development of our throwaway society combined with our traditional online dating websites has created the perfect objectification storm called Tinder. While traditional online dating websites have definitively fueled the fire of objectifying people, Tinder has metaphorically lit a blowtorch on the issue. The more our society perpetuates objectification, the greater we are disconnected as a society. Finally, technology’s attempt to connect us globally by eliminating the language barriers and physical distance barriers is really creating a larger disconnect in our society. Social networks such as Snapchat are giving us more frequent updates from our friends, but these updates are shallow and lack the deep connection that in-person social interaction can provide us. Advancements in technology are connecting us in increasing ways to technology and consequently disconnecting us from what really matters in life - the people in it.
