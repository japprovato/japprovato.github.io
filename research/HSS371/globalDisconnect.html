<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancements in technology have provided our society with a myriad of tools to help aid us in communicating with one another. Machine Translation allows for the partial dissolution of language barriers. Social networks such as Facebook, video webcam chat software such as Skype, email, and many other forms of connection services have allowed us many mediums via the internet for communicating with people both near and far, making physical distance barriers less challenging. Advancements in the hardware field have allowed for computers and internet access to be increasingly more affordable, breaking social class boundaries and allowing more people than ever to be online (Hoffman, 2012, p. 193). All of these technologies and more have been developed to bring us closer to the people we care about, but in reality they are making the distance even greater.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sociologist Robert Putnam (2000) has documented the dramatic decrease in voluntary community involvement, such as bowling leagues or knitting clubs, since the introduction of the television sets in the 1950s. With the mainstream adaptation of television, “mankind now possesses for the first time the tools and knowledge to create whatever world he wants” (Putnam, 2000, p. 16). If having one television set in every home had such a dramatic effect on our social capital in the 1950s, where are we today? On top of having multiple television sets in the average American household, we are more connected to technology than ever. The average American home has at least one computer with internet access, and it's more likely that each member of the family has their own laptop or tablet. Factoring in the fact that the internet is definitively more interactive than a television set, and that televisions themselves are now able to be connected to the internet, and the sheer number of internet enabled devices in the average American household, it is clear that, following Putnam’s thought process, our society is even more removed from our neighborhood communities than ever before.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue that because technology is ultra portable now, and we can do things like watch television on the go on our smartphones, our voluntary community involvement could spring back up from where it decreased in the 1950s. While it is true that we could watch television on our smartphones, or alternatively record our television episodes using DVR and watch them at a later time, or most realistically watch most of our shows using on-demand streaming sites such as Netflix or Hulu, that does not magically fix the problem of decreased community involvement. We literally carry a computer around in our pocket everywhere we go nowadays, so it is safe to say we are constantly connected to our devices, which is where the societal and communal disconnect perpetuates. Even if current members of our society did show up to the community events of the 1950s such as bowling leagues, they would still be glued to their smartphones and not nearly as engaged as previous generations were with the people and communities around them. It is true that the advancements in technology over the years have produced many improvements to our lives, for example we no longer have to print out directions from MapQuest when we drive somewhere new because we have a GPS in our smartphones. However, the “improvements” that technology has brought to how we connect with each other as humans have actually disconnected us from each other.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social networking sites and mobile applications such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat are always working and releasing new features to have their users use their product as often as possible to stay in business and to remain household names. Obviously, the best business strategy to achieve this goal is to have your product used as much as possible by as many people as possible. As a result, more and more users are sharing more and more about their daily lives to social media (honestly, I have been posting updates about my progress on this research project to my snapchat story as I write it). One of the biggest successes at having their product used as often as possible throughout the day is Snapchat, a social networking application where users can ‘snap’ pictures, add captions and then share them with some or all of their friends - the catch is that their friends can only see the picture for at most ten seconds. A user can open up the snapchat app, and (depending on how active their friends are) see snapshots of their day. A typical day as told by a snapchat story can be told as follows: a selfie of User A in bed just waking up, a picture of User A’s morning coffee, a picture of User A at the gym, a picture of User A’s dinner, a video of User A and friends at a concert, and finally ending the day with a picture of User A’s bed with a sleepy emoji added. Features of Snapchat allow series of snaps similar to the above mentioned to, if desired by the user, include timestamps and/or “geofilters” which are small vector graphics that can be added to snapchat pictures based on your GPS location that show what city or town you are in. More recently, snapchat has expanded geofilters to be as geographically specific as a specific building and exist on the application for as short as a day allowing them to be address and even event specific. This combination of pictures, times, and locations encourages users to share increasingly frequent updates about their daily lives. This ability for more constant updates (without seeming annoying as one would if they posted a Facebook status for each of the events discussed above each day) can allow friends who otherwise do not spend their entire day together, or who do not see each other for months or years, to get a more sensory-involved and in depth idea of their friends’ daily lives than a tweet or series of tweets could generally provide. In this sense, we have the ability to feel much closer to our friends than we would have decades ago (unless our friends mailed out a handwritten letter to each of their friends each day updating them on details such as what they ate for lunch and whether they went to the gym or not). While these updates are more frequent, they are shallow and disconnected compared to face-to-face interaction. They lack the physiological reactions of in-person social interactions and lack the substance of an actual conversation.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC), such as snapchatting, text messaging, emailing, tweeting, or facebook messaging, is shallower than in-person interactions because it lacks the nonverbal features of communication such as tone of voice, facial expressions, and potentially influential interpersonal features such as physical attractiveness, skin color, gender, and so on (Bargh, 2004, p. 577). The need to connect deeply with other has been described as a “fundamental human motivation” and the lack of these deep connections can affect one’s health and potentially lead to depression (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). These deep connections cannot be fully developed or maintained solely through Computer-Mediated communication because this type of communication lacks the physical and physiological reactions that face-to-face communication can provide.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Computer-Mediated Communication has provided efficient and innovative solutions to societal barriers such as language barriers and physical distance barriers, it has also disconnected ourselves from each other as members of our society. Quantity of digital correspondence from an individual, such as snapchats, facebook messages, or tweets, does not correspond to quality of the connection between the individuals involved. These Computer-Mediated forms of communication do not foster the necessary deep bonds people receive from face-to-face interactions. Despite these communication forms being more shallow than face-to-face interactions, they are increasingly popular within our society. The lack of fundamental deep connections with other humans is the result of technology and social networking sites increasingly disconnecting us as a society.</p>
