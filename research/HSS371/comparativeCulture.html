<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boyd and Ellison (2007) define social networking sites as “web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system. The nature and nomenclature of these connections may vary from site to site.” Generally, these profiles consist of information such as age, location, interests, and a profile photo, creating a short, one page, autobiography-like representation of oneself. Online dating sites, which are a type of social networking site, have one main variation from Boyd’s definition of a social networking sites. This variation is that instead of focusing almost exclusively on existing and shared social connections, such as old college friends and extended family members (Boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007), online dating sites put the emphasis on connecting with strangers (Adams, 2013, p. 150).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating online “may enable participants to express themselves more openly and honestly than in face-to-face contexts” (Ellison, 2006). Who you “really are” can be split into three domains - one’s “actual self” which consists of the attributes that person actually possesses, one’s “ideal self” which consists of the attributes that person would ideally possess, and one’s “ought self” which consists of attributes that someone feels that person should possess (Higgins, 1987, p.  321). Technology, social networking sites, and online dating sites can all be very affectatious to each of these domains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The added level of comfort that the anonymity of a computer screen can provide users with may allow them to open up and display their “true self” to a greater degree than in in-person interactions. Therefore, certain aspects of their “actual self” are expressed to those they interact with via social networking sites. Users may experience trouble expressing themselves these ways in-person, so the internet provides a better medium for expressing themselves more “truly”. For example, one may struggle to express their true feelings to someone while speaking face-to-face, but can easily write at length in an email or chat service explaining how they feel. The reasoning behind this may have to do with the removal of conversational pressures, allowing the user to take as long as they’d like to formulate a response. Whatever the reasoning behind it may be, it is clear that many people feel more comfortable interacting online than in person.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in comfort communicating online can lead to a greater connection both to the people we are sharing this connection with, as well as with our “actual self”. One could create a deeper understanding of who they really are based on these online interactions and apply that to their in-person relations. At the same time, online profiles allow users to attempt to present parts of their “ideal self” as if it were their “actual self”. For example, if someone was self-conscious about their weight and chose to hide that aspect of their “actual self” from their online profile, they could choose to only post pictures of their face. In a study done about online dating profiles, a majority of the participants consciously misrepresented traits about themselves, most popularly age, height, and weight (Adams, 2013, p. 150). People are actively using online profiles as a means to convince others that aspects of their “ideal self” are entirely their “actual self”.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a user’s profile is their online representation of themselves, and a user ultimately decides what to put on their profile, they are presented with a unique opportunity to really define themselves within the bounds of the website. As a result, “online daters must balance two conflicting goals – they need to present oneself in the most positive light in order to attract a mate, while simultaneously knowing that one must be honest if one wants their relationship to progress past the first meeting” (Adams, 2013, p. 151).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, everyone attempts to present a more ideal version of themselves online. This creates a continuous cycle of misinterpretation. User A sees the profile of User B and questions why their life is not fun, exciting, or generally positive as User B which, as a result, lowers their self-esteem. User A now edits their online presence to make them appear as if their life is just as fun and exciting as User B, so User A is presenting their “Ideal self”. The catch is that User B is only presenting their “ideal self” as well. So User A is comparing their “actual self” to User B’s “ideal self” as if it were User B’s “actual self”. This can create similar self-esteem issues to comparing one’s looks to those of magazine models. The pictures of magazine models are very heavily edited using photo editing software, so comparing your true self to the idealized pictures of models in magazines is an unfair comparison.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comparisons do not end there. Another example of how many social media users weigh their ‘online value’ on more quantitative values such as number of followers or number of likes on one’s profile picture. Once you factor in both the qualitative aspects of a user’s profile, such as their pictures or text posts, and the quantitative aspects mentioned above, social networks have trained their users to be, whether consciously or subconsciously, highly competitive and comparative. While this comparative culture that has developed as a result of social networking sites can absolutely lead to users’ lower self-esteem, a sub-domain that paves the way for an even deeper emotional disturbance of self worth is online dating sites.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it’s not exactly ‘all fun and games’ to participate in social networking sites’ comparative culture, it is a less abrasive sibling to online dating sites. Comparative culture is an implicit result of social networking sites because it is not related to the main goals of the website, nor was it necessarily intended to be a result of the website. When a user happens to be scrolling through their newsfeed and they see a picture of one of their connections smiling while on a beach, they may compare that to their current location and/or mood and as a result feel bad, jealous, or other emotions. Social networking sites like Facebook did not create the ability to post pictures to cause this result. The connection who posted the picture of themselves on a beach did not do so to invoke any feelings of inferiority in their connection pool (or at least one would hope). These feelings were an implicit result of the post on the social networking site.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, comparative culture is an explicit result of online dating sites. Online dating sites are inherently built around comparison. Online dating sites give you access to hundreds or thousands of potential new partners, and it’s your job to sort through them to find your “matches”. Even websites, such as EHarmony, that use mathematical algorithms to find matches for you, you still need to sort through and compare those profiles to see which ones you are most interested in. This comparative culture that is only perpetuated by online dating sites can lead members of our society to be increasingly self-conscious about whether their profile is ‘good enough’, and as a result these concerns can easily be projected onto their “actual self” leading to lower self-esteem and other potentially negative effects.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prevalence of comparative culture in social networking sites and online dating sites shows the negative effects technology can have to the self-esteem of users. Both the qualitative and quantitative comparative aspects of these sites, as well as the misinterpretation and miscomparison of the actual self and the ideal self on these sites are proof that social networking sites and online dating sites can lead to lowered self-esteem of users as well as feelings of inadequacy as a result of comparing skewed perceptions of others to oneself. The competitivity that results from social networking sites and online dating sites is one way that advancements in technology have pitted ourselves against each other and disconnected us as a society.</p>
