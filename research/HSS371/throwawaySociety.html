<p>We are living in a throw-away society, a human society strongly influenced by consumerism whose members actively participate in overconsumption and excessive production of short-lived and disposable items (Durning, 1992, p. 28). Although this term is not restricted to the bounds of technology, as it is equally applicable to our food waste, household products, clothing, and just about anything a consumer can buy, for the sake of the argument we will focus how the idea of throw-away society has applied to consumer technology, and in turn how that has influenced our relationships.
    
    As a society we have come to accept the short life expectancy of our consumer products. Decades ago, if you bought a TV it was likely that you would keep that same TV for decades. Both for cost effective reasons and rapidly advancing technology allowing for constant upgraded models to be released, companies are constantly releasing new models for their consumer electronics. In attempts to always have the latest and greatest tech gadgets, consumers will buy new televisions and smartphones even when their current models are in perfect working condition. This is a result of the throw-away society we live in, and it has changed our culture’s mindset that almost everything is disposable. When you know that something is disposable and can be easily replaced, it loses a portion of its value as a result.

    What does the release of the latest iPhone model have to do with our interpersonal relationships? Because our society has adopted an ‘out with the old, in with the new’ mindset, we have come to apply that logic not only to our material possessions, but also to the people in our lives. Online dating sites and dating applications for mobile devices are only perpetuating our society’s throw-away mindset. Online dating sites create a markedly different experience than traditional social scenarios. Generally, online dating sites offer users access to potentially thousands of profiles simultaneously, on-demand, and from the comfort of their own home. Additionally, users can almost effortlessly initiate conversation with any of these profiles. In the real world, it is rare for singles to encounter a large array of potential partners simultaneously. Even at a party, a single person cannot obviously tell which party goers are looking for a romantic relationship. Going further, even if it was a party specifically for single people, as we saw previously in this paper, people are more comfortable interacting with strangers online than having to deal with the added stress of a face-to-face social scenario (Finkel et al, 2012, p. 30).

    Based on the large choice sets, the experience of searching for potential romantic partners via online dating sites and mobile applications resembles an online shopping experience much more than it resembles a traditional dating situation. In both online dating sites and online shopping sites users browse their options online, with potential to filter out different preferences, making judgements and formulating opinions on whether they should invest in the “product”  - whether that investment is money when online shopping or time and emotional energy when browsing potential online romantic prospects. This resemblance to a shopping experience causes users of online dating sites to become homologous to merchandise, which makes them comparable to objects.

    One of the supposed benefits of online dating sites is having access to a greater number of potential romantic matches (Finkel et al, 2012, p. 26), but does quantity drive quality when it comes to romantic matches. A speed-dating study (which closely mirrors online dating due to the participants having to assess a set of potential romantic candidates in a short amount of time, much like browsing online profiles) showed that at larger events, speed-daters were less likely to “match” with other speed-daters based on characteristics that are harder to evaluate, such as occupational status or highest educational degree earned, and more likely to be motivated by relatively easy characteristics such as weight and height (Lenton &amp; Francesconi, 2010). This shows that the more options available via online dating can actually lead to less thorough decision making based off of more shallow, objectifying characteristics rather than genuine connections or common interests while matching with candidates.

    A similar study found that women at a speed dating event with a smaller set of potential partners were over 40% more likely to agree to a follow-up meeting with any given potential partner than were women who attended events where they met a larger amount of potential partners. Although not directly related to the romantic domain, a study found that people who selected a chocolate from an array of 6 chocolates thought the chocolate tasted significantly better than did participants who selected their chocolate from an array of 30 (Finkel et al, 2012, p. 31). Although one would think that the greater the number of potential partners the more likely one would be to find the best possible match, these studies show that the opposite is actually true. In the case of romantic partners, quantity does not drive quality. More options for potential partners generalizes the search and takes away from the individuality of the candidates, and as a result perpetuates the objectification of users.

    Traditional online dating sites perpetuate the objectification of people caused by the consumerist nature of our throw-away society, but the latest and increasingly popular online dating mobile application takes our society’s consumerist mindset and emboldens it to an even greater degree. Tinder is an online dating mobile application that, in contrast to traditional online dating sites which feature extensive profile information that users fill out to help aid in the matching process, has a very limited profile for users that features only the user’s age, first name, photos, and an optional abbreviated blurb. Tinder finds matches based solely on the user’s current location and preferred gender. Potential matches consist of anyone else on the mobile application within a set geographical range from you (such as a five mile radius) and will be placed in your potential match queue. For each potential match that shows up on the screen, the user must either swipe right to “like” them or swipe left to dismiss them. If two users have swiped right on each other, they are matched and then connected through a chat window (Schacter, 2015). The minimal information presented to a user about their potential match requires a snap judgement to be made almost entirely on looks and not deeper characteristics such as values. This creates an experience even closer to online shopping, where you are only given a select number of pictures of the item. In many ways, online shopping is better tailored to make a more well thought out decision compared to tinder, because shoppers are usually given a detailed description, can read reviews on the item, and at the very least can walk away from the website and come back to purchase the item at a later time. Tinder can be considered the Black Friday online shopping experience compared to traditional online dating being a standard online shopping experience. Swiping left is like putting an item back on the shelf on Black Friday, you will not be able to find it again. This method of superficial, quick-judgement online dating adds another thick layer of objectification on top of the already existing layer in our society’s sphere of online dating.

    The inherent objectification of users present in online dating sites is an extension and example of our throw-away society. Members of a throw-away society will unforgivingly throw away objects, even if they are perfectly functional, when a newer model is released. When this mindset is applied to the romantic domain, people will end relationships or marriages with perfectly adequate partners in exchange for ‘newer, shinier versions’ with little remorse relative to generations ago when people would marry young, usually with their first romantic partner, and stay married for life. This societal idea that there may always be something better available, which can lead to serious commitment issues, can be applied the same way to potential romantic partners and shopping which reinforces the objectification of online dating users. This is one way that advancements in technology have disconnected us as a society.
