<p>Advancements in technology resulting from the internet becoming a mainstream part of our society have brought about countless solutions and improvements to problems in our world that previously seemed impossible. Along with all of the good things that the internet has brought to our world, there have been a number of negative societal effects that have resulted from it as well. Although disconnecting society not inherently built into social networking sites, online dating sites, or other forms of Computer-Mediated Communication, it has been built into them by the people. Motivated by the contrast between Computer-Mediated Communicationâ€™s main function of connecting people over the internet and the realities of its side effects on our society, this project explores the implicit negative effects Computer-Mediated Communication has on our interpersonal relationships and our society as a whole.</p>
